    <p id="size">In an HTML document, headings act like titles. These titles come in various sizes, much like the ones we find when we do word processing in Microsoft Word/Google Docs.</p>

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>

    <p id="size">Which is the largest.</p>

    <h2>Heading 2</h2>

    <h3>Heading 3</h3>

    <h4>Heading 4</h4>

    <h5>Heading 5</h5>

    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

    <p id="size">Which is the smallest heading.</p>

    <p id="size">It is important to remember, headings are for important titles. Don't use headings to represent bold or larger front sized words. There are other tags that we use to perform those functions. More on that in Challenge 2.</p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p id="size">Challenge 1 is a simple HTML document. Your mission, is to recreate it exactly as you see it here.</p>
