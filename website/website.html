    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Omercan Ozkan</h3>
    <h4></h5>

    <p>My name is Omercan. I'm 17 years old, and I'm currently a Grade 11 student attending Martingrove Collegiate Institute. I live in a family of 4, which includes me, my mom, my dad, and my younger brother. My brother is 1 year younger than me, meaning that he is in Grade 10.</p>

    <p>I don't always have free time, but when I do, I usually resort to video games to roll back and relax. I usually play FPS (first-person shooter) games, where I'm constantly active and focused, or I'll play some casual chill games that are enjoyable with friends, like Mario Party.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, technology is something that we use in everyday situations, whether it's setting up the navigation on your GPS, or submitting a pdf to your teacher online. Technology is important, and the status of it, compared to 10-20 years ago, is fascinating and interesting to me. In the future, I aspire to be a software engineer, or a computer engineer. Either one of the other works for, that's what I'm currently deciding to do at the moment.</p>
