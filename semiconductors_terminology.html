        <td>Semiconductor</td>
        <td>materials that have a conductivity between conductors and insulators.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Covalent Bonds</td>
        <td>the sharing of one or more pairs of electrons between two atoms.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Doping</td>
        <td>the process of adding an impurity into the semiconductor to increase its ability to conduct electricity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>N-type crystal</td>
        <td>a semiconductor in which electrical conduction is due mainly to the movement of electrons.</td>
        </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>P-type crystal</td>
        <td>a semiconductor that primarily conducts electricity in the movement of positive holes.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Forward bias</td>
        <td>where the external voltage is delivered across the P-N junction diode.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Reverse bias</td>
        <td>putting a voltage across a diode in the opposite direction, blocking the flow of current</td>
